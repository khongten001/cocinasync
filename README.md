# CocinAsync #

A high performance library for Delphi to simplify coding and improve performance of asynchronous and multithreaded applications.

### Unit: cocinasync.async
*Inline coding helpers for implementing asynchronous actions*

This unit includes two synchronization helpers that make it easy to make sure code is executed in the main thread.  They automatically protect you from accidentally synchronizing from the main thread.

```
#!delphi

TAsync.SynchronizeIfInThread(
  procedure
  begin
    // Do something in the main thread
  end
);

TAsync.QueueIfInThread(
  procedure
  begin
    // Do something in the main thread
  end
);

```

Asynchronous operations can easily be performed inline in code.  The global Async object may be used when lifetime of the async operations is not dependent upon another object (like a form or data module).

```
#!delphi

Async.AfterDo(1000, 
  procedure
  begin
    // Execute this code after waiting 1s
  end
);

Async.DoLater(
  procedure
  begin
    // Execute this code at some point in the very near future.
  end
);

Async.OnDo(
  function : boolean
  begin
    // Check for some condition, return true if the due should be executed. False if it should not
  end,
  procedure
  begin
    // Executes only when the condition above has been met
  end,
  1000, // interval on which the check function should be called
  function : boolean
  begin
    // Return True to continue checking or False to abort
  end
);

Aync.DoEvery(1000,
  function : boolean
  begin
    // Execute this function every 1s. Return True to allow it to execute again or False to stop.
  end
);

```

When lifetime of an asynchronous operation depends upon another object such as a form or data module, create an instance of TAsync for that object.  If the global Async is used, then it's possible the asynchronous methods will be called after needed objects are freed.


```
#!delphi

procedure FormCreate(Sender : TObject);
begin
  FAsync := TAsync.Create;
  FAsync.DoEvery(10,
    procedure
    begin
      Shape1.Left := Random(Width-Shape1.Width);
    end
  );
end;

procedure FormDestroy(Sender : TObject);
begin
  FAsync.Free;
end;
```


### Unit: cocinasync.collections ###
*Lock-Free generic collection classes for high performance use in mutlithreaded applications*

* TQueue<T> - high performance queue collection that is thread safe without locking
* TStack<T> - high performance stack collection that is thread safe without locking
* THash<T> - high performance hash collection that is thread safe without locking

### cocinasync.global ###

*Utility objects*

### cocinasync.jobs ###

*A background job runner which easily executes tasks in the background*

Delphi's System.Threading unit includes a Task execution library which on it's surface is very useful.  It suffers from a throttling algorithm that can cause performance issues for some workloads.  Jobs is an attempt to execute background tasks in a highly performant way through natural throttling based on workload and system capacity.  By default a global Jobs runner is created with one running thread per logical processor on the system.  


```
#!delphi
// Queue a background job that will execute as soon as an idle job runner notices it.
TJobManager.Excute(
  procedure
  begin
    // Add something to the Jobs Queue and execute as soon as possible
  end
);

// Jobs can also return values.  Asking for the return value 
// will cause the thread to wait until the value is available.
jobCount := TJobManager.Execute<Integer>(
  function : Integer
  begin
    Result := 0;
    for i := 1 to 30 do
    begin 
     sleep(1000)
     inc(Result);
    end
  end
);

// ... do some other work here in the main thread or in other jobs

Result := jobCount.Result; // will stop execution of this thread here until 
                           // the jobCount job has returned it's result.
                           // NOTE: if you do this in the main thread, 
                           // gui operations will block at this point until 
                           // the job returns.  Also, if using in the main thread
                           // do not do operations from within the job that execute
                           // through synchronization as it will cause a deadlock.



// Sometimes you want to do a bunch of jobs and wait for them all to complete.  
// To do this you can use a TJobQueue

queue := TJobQueue.Create;

TJobManager.Execute(
  procedure
  begin
    // do something important
  end,
  queue
);

TJobManager.Execute(
  procedure
  begin
    // do something else here
  end,
  queue
);

queue.WaitForAll; // Execution will stop here until all of the jobs in the queue have completed.

```

Depending upon workload, it may be desirable to create a separate jobs queue for a particular workload.  To do so call CreateJobs() with the number of threads you wish to dedicate to running the jobs.


```
#!delphi

procedure FormCreate(Sender : TObject);
begin
  // Create a Jobs Runner with 25 threads
  // Note that there is a default job runner under a global variable "Jobs"
  // which should suffice in most applications.
  FJobs := TJobManager.CreateJobs(25); 
end; 

procedure Button1Click(Sender : TObject);
begin
  FJobs.Queue(
    procedure
    begin
      // Add some workload to the jobs runner
    end
  );
end;

```


### Contribution guidelines ###

* Fork and PR
* Fixes to the core library are welcome and encouraged
* Performance improvement PRs must be provable
* Additions to the library will be accepted if it furthers the project goal to simplify asynchronous and multithreaded development and to do so with a focus on high performance.
